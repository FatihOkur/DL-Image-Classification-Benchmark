# DL-Image-Classification-Benchmark
A comparative study of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and LeNet-5 CNN architectures for image classification on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Analyzes the impact of activation functions (ReLU/Sigmoid), batch sizes, loss functions (CE/MSE), and optimizers (SGD/Adam) on model performance and feature space separation.
